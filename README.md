# Grocery_App

We are going to create a grocery app. This app will take products from different stores, compare their prices, and displace the cheapest. It should also show the customer the nearest store they can go to buy the product. We need to also consider checking the quality of the product e.g. their expiration date. 

Note: I'll keep on adding more requirements as time goes by.
